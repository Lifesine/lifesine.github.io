After a bit of a hiatus, it felt so good to get back on the decks to work on this one, and in a twist, it came together faster than any mix before! In a record-setting three sessions and exports 'Freeflow' was born and needed no further fine tuning. Featuring loads of melodic house & techno, plus a few fun curveballs give this mix that classic Lifesine vibe.

It's been a little while – so do be sure to enjoy, and turn it up...
